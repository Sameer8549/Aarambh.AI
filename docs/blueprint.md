## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Lavender (#E6E6FA), chosen for its calming and soothing effect, promoting a sense of tranquility.
- Background color: Sandalwood Beige (#F5F5DC), providing a warm, neutral backdrop that complements the lavender without overpowering it.
- Accent color: Peacock Blue (#00A693), used to draw attention to important interactive elements. Its slightly brighter and more saturated hue stands out against the lavender and sandalwood beige.
- Font: 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif, will be used for both headlines and body text, balancing modernity and approachability.
- Custom icons representing Chat, Music, Breathing, Journaling, Books, Resources, and Helpline; icons are simple, line-based, and filled with the primary color to indicate the purpose.
- Mobile-first, single-column layout for easy navigation, mimicking a familiar WhatsApp-style chat interface; content is organized in clean, rounded cards.
- Subtle, non-distracting animations for transitions and feedback, enhancing user engagement without overwhelming the user (e.g., breathing circle).
